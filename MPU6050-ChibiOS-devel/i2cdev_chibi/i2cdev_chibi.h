// I2Cdev library collection - Main I2C device class header file
// Abstracts bit and byte I2C R/W functions into a convenient class
// 6/9/2012 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
//
// Changelog:
//     2012-06-09 - fix major issue with reading > 32 bytes at a time with Arduino Wire
//                - add compiler warnings when using outdated or IDE or limited I2Cdev implementation
//     2011-11-01 - fix write*Bits mask calculation (thanks sasquatch @ Arduino forums)
//     2011-10-03 - added automatic Arduino version detection for ease of use
//     2011-10-02 - added Gene Knight's NBWire TwoWire class implementation with small modifications
//     2011-08-31 - added support for Arduino 1.0 Wire library (methods are different from 0.x)
//     2011-08-03 - added optional timeout parameter to read* methods to easily change from default
//     2011-08-02 - added support for 16-bit registers
//                - fixed incorrect Doxygen comments on some methods
//                - added timeout value for read operations (thanks mem @ Arduino forums)
//     2011-07-30 - changed read/write function structures to return success or byte counts
//                - made all methods static for multi-device memory savings
//     2011-07-28 - initial release

/* ChibiOS I2Cdev Main I2C device class conversion 2/5/2013 by Jan Schlemminger - C conversion, ChibiOS compliance
 * First release. I just tested byte-based reading so this should be considered HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!!!
 * 
 * 
 * Feel free to test and report bugs. Updates at https://github.com/jevermeister/MPU6050-ChibiOS
